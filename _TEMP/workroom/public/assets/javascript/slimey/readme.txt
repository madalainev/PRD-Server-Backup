What is Slimey?
===============

	* Slimey is an open source web-based slideshow editor. Slimey aims to be simple,
    yet provide the most common features you would expect from a slideshow editor.

	* Slimey aims to be compatible with most of the modern web browsers.

	* Slimey was born as part of the OpenGoo web office project, but was made a
	seperate project to let it evolve it's own way and better benefit the open source
	community.

About Slimey 0.2
================

	0.1 is the first release of Slimey. This version provides basic
	functionality and the ability to create, edit and present slideshows in it's
	own format (SLIM), based on html, css and javascript. It's a desirable feature
	to allow interoperability with other existing slideshow formats in the future.

	0.2 adds the ability to reorder slides and fits the editor to the available
	space, so that it is always fully visible.

	Functionality:

		* Insert text, images and bulleted lists
		* Add and remove slides
		* Delete elements
		* Drag and drop to place elements on the slide
		* Undo / Redo
		* Change font face, font color and font size of elements
		* Bold, underline and italic
		* Bring to front and send to back elements
		* View source code
		* Preview slideshow
		* Save slideshow

	Tested successfully on:

		* IE 6+
		* Firefox 2+
		* Opera 9+
		* Safari 3+
		* Chrome

Thank you for trying Slimey!
