<b>OBJECTIVE</b><br>
Roller derby started out as an endurance trial in the 1930's between twenty-five teams of two (read more in <a href="http://www.providencerollerderby.com/history.htm"><u>History</u></a>). Today's roller derby is still essentially a race between jammers of opposing teams through a pack of blockers. There's no finish line in this race however: jammers are attemting to score as many points in a set period of time as possible. Points are scored by passing members of the opposing team.
<br><br>
<b>KEY TERMS</b><br>
<i>Jammer</i>: Scores points for her team<br>
<i>Lead Jammer</i>: The jammer that passes through the entire pack inbounds first and earns the ability to call off a jam to prevent the opposing team's jammer from scoring<br>
<i>Blocker</i>: Keeps the opposing team's jammer from scoring points while clearing a path for her own team's jammer to score<br>
<i>Pivot</i>: A blocker who can switch positions with the jammer<br>
<i>Pack</i>: The formation of blockers and pivots<br>
<i>Jam</i>: A two minute countdown during which jammers attempt to score points for their team<br>
<i>Period</i>: A twenty minute session of jams<br><br>
<b>RULES OF THE GAME</b><br>
Two teams send five girls onto a circular and flat track. Each team consists of one jammer, one pivot, and four blockers. The pivots from each team take position on the first line on the track. Behind them, a row of four blockers takes position, and a final row of two girls take position in the back- forming a "pack".
<br><br>
Twenty feet behind the pack, the two jammers take position on their own line. The referee blows the first whistle, signaling "jam formation", during which the pack skates counter-clockwise around the track. Pivots and blockers must remain within the pack and no more that twenty feet ahead of or behind other pack members. After the last girl in the pack has skated past the pivot line, the referee blows a second whistle, which signals the start of a jam.
<br><br>
A jam is a two-minute countdown during which the jammers attempt to score points for their teams. Points can only be scored by jammers, who, moving counter-clockwise, attempt to pass the pack and and lap around as many times as possible. After the first time the jammer passes the pack, jammers earn one point per opposing team member that they pass while in-bounds.
<br><br>
To impede the progress of the opposing team's jammer, players may block using body parts above the hips, exluding hands, elbows, and head. If a skater makes an inappropriate block, she is sent to a penalty box, during which time, the opposing team's jammer can score points by passing the penalty box. Penalties are also given for fighting and unsportsman-like behavior, and skaters can be ejected from a bout if they get too many penalties. A jammer can be blocked by any member of the opposing team, including the opposing team's jammer. A jammer cannot be blocked by a member of the opposing team that is further than 20 feet from the pack. Illegal blocking moves include tripping, pushing with elbows or forearms, and pushing an opponent from behind (back-blocking).
<br><br>
The first jammer to pass all of the pivots and blockers earns the status of lead jammer for the remainder of the jam. The lead jammer can decide to end the jam before the end of two minutes by placing her hands on her hips, which signals the referee to officially call off the jam.
<br><br>
After a lead jammer has been established, both jammers have the option of passing their positions to their respective team's pivot by passing their helmet covers. The jammer then becomes the pivot and the pivot becomes the jammer for the remainder of the jam. If the original jammer was lead jammer, the position of lead jammer is not passed on: the position is forfeited for the rest of the jam.
<br><br>
Each bout consists of three 20 minute periods. At the end of each jam, the skaters re-form the pack and continue play.
