For those of you not familiar, Roller Derby began as an alternative sport during the 1930's to 
compete with dance marathons. Today the thrill of contact, collisions, carnage, and the allure 
of attractive, powerful women has become the trademark of a sport that regained national 
popularity in 2001. <br /><br />
Sarah &quot;Doom&quot; Kingan #4.0, a Brown University alumnus, established PRD 
in 2004. She originally trained with Tuscon Roller derby while on an internship in Arizona. 
After moving back to the east coast, her love of the sport drove her to establish the first flat 
track derby league in New England. Skaters were recruited and trained for over a year before 
creating two teams. Over the past four years membership has continued to grow. Today's 
PRD consists of three home teams Mob Squad, Old Money Honeys, Sakonet River Roller Rats, 
and our travel teams: the Killah Bees and all star RI Riveters. <br /><br />

Currently there are more than 100 established and start-up roller derby leagues in the world 
with bouts being held on a monthly basis with anywhere between 300-3000 fans attending 
events. PRD fans rock my world. In many respects, the resurgence of roller derby can be 
attributed to the ability of these modern day Kansas City Bombers, to change with the times. 
Fake fights and hair pulls are no longer part of a sport likened to wwwf wrestling. The 2008 
version features real hitting, blocking, and skating with rock n roll flair. This aint your 
grandmother's derby! <br /><br />

Providence Roller Derby is gearing up for the fourth year. Do not miss any of the high speed 
mayhem as these lovely ladies lace up their skates for another heart pounding season. Watch 
as downtown Providence comes alive with the thrill and excitement of a sport that has 
become a worldwide phenomenon.
