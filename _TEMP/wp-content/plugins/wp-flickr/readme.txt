Insert photos into your posts and pages, browsing your Flickr PhotoStream, Favorites or Sets, directly from the WordPress admin.

== Description ==

Based on the excellent Flickr Tag plugin by Jeffrey Maki. WP-Flickr takes a different approach of inserting a standard html `<img>` tag to your post, rather than using custom tags that are rendered when the article is displayed. WP-Flickr also allows you to browse and add photos from your Public Flickr Photostream, Favorites or Sets, straight into your post or pages, directly from the WordPress admin interface.

Choose a size and click on the image - it's inserted into your post.

UPDATED: 28/04/08 - Now compatible with WorPress 2.5, Includes fixes for curl not being present and now uses AJAX to update photo tray.
